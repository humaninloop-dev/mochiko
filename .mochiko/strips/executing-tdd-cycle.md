# Strip notes — `skills/executing-tdd-cycle/`

Entry formats: `strips/README.md`. Wave context: workflow-token-reduction wave 1 (design:
`.mochiko/brainstorms/workflow-token-reduction/record.md`, D3 + S8 + Q6; rulings ratified
2026-07-23) — reports strip to their verified consumers, machine-first.

## [v0.22.0] Cycle-report prose sections (What Was Done · Decisions Made · Notes for Next Cycle)
- **Disposition:** deleted from `references/CYCLE-REPORT-FORMAT.md` (What Was Done, Decisions Made) · deleted per the epic's Q6 ruling, **no optional-field resurrection** (Notes for Next Cycle)
- **Tier failed:** consumption evidence (epic F-c): the user never reads cycle reports (Q4); the next cycle never reads the file (15/15 kinako reports authored the section, 0 back-references — the standing seat carries the context); fix/retry consumes a lead-relayed failure list
- **Content:** `### What Was Done` — narrative of what was implemented "in enough detail for the lead and the next cycle" (restated tasks.md); `### Decisions Made` — technology/pattern choices + trade-offs narrative; `### Notes for Next Cycle` — files/interfaces affecting future cycles, patterns established, potential conflicts, improvement opportunities. Replacements: non-obvious decisions + difficulties/blockers → the conditional `## Notes of note` block; deviations → the `deviations:` frontmatter list; failed cycles keep a mandatory `## Failure narrative` (S8). Improvement-opportunity noting (refactor-discipline pressure valve) retargeted to Notes of note (SKILL.md Common Mistakes).
- **Re-add trigger:** a dogfood run where the lead's checkpoint verdict or a fix pass demonstrably starved for the dropped narrative on a *passing* cycle (evidence-gated, marked override).
