## [v0.78.0] Delegating Cheap Reads retargeted — `mochiko:explorer` dispatch superseded by native `Explore` + `model: haiku` override

- **Disposition:** superseded → the reworded `## Delegating Cheap Reads` sentence: "spawn a
  disposable native `Explore` subagent with an explicit `model: haiku` override (the
  override makes the read cheap; a bare spawn inherits the session tier)".
- **Tier failed:** n/a — supersession by ruling (ADR
  `.mochiko/decisions/2026-08-19-explorer-retarget-native.md`; `DECISIONS.md` 2026-08-19
  row). Dogfood failure: agent-team teammates cannot spawn plugin-scoped agents, so the
  `mochiko:explorer` dispatch this section prescribed failed on exactly the transport the
  section was built for.
- **Content:** verbatim superseded span (identical across all ten personas): "spawn a
  disposable `mochiko:explorer` subagent (its `model: haiku` frontmatter makes the read
  cheap)".
- **Kept deliberately:** the rest of the `## Delegating Cheap Reads` section byte-for-byte —
  the class-key summary (locate/enumerate/targeted-read cheap; interpretive, absence-driven,
  completeness-sensitive kept), one-gap-per-spawn, the bulk-read-stays-out rule, and the
  closing pointer to `mochiko:patterns-model-tiering`.
- **Consumers assessed:** the section wording is shared across the ten personas; all ten
  edited in the same v0.78.0 wave (this entry mirrored in each persona's strip file). No
  command or skill names the section.
