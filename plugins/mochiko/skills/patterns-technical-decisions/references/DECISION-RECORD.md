# Decision Record Reference

Full ADR format, consequence documentation, dependency tracking, and constitution alignment.

## Decision Record Format

Each significant decision should follow this structure:

```markdown
## Decision: [Concise title]

### Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by DR-XXX]

### Context

[What is the situation that requires a decision? What forces are at play?]

### Decision

[What is the change being proposed or implemented?]

### Rationale

[Why was this decision made? Connect to specific evaluation criteria.]

### Alternatives Considered

[What other options were evaluated? Why were they rejected?]

### Consequences

[What are the implications of this decision?]
- Positive: [Benefits]
- Negative: [Costs, trade-offs]
- Neutral: [Changes that are neither good nor bad]
```

## Where these records land

The decision records above are written into the **`constraints-and-decisions.md`** artifact. Its file structure — the Summary table, the per-decision `D-XXX` sections, the Dependencies table, and the Open Questions / escalation list — together with the `D-XXX` field schema and `C-XXX`↔`D-XXX` / `IP-XXX` traceability are owned by `mochiko:authoring-technical-requirements`. Author the decision *content* with the format above; place it into that artifact's `D-XXX` slots — do not restate the artifact shape here.

## RFC 2119 Keywords

Use RFC 2119 keywords for constraints:

| Keyword | Meaning | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **MUST** | Absolute requirement | Non-negotiable constraint |
| **MUST NOT** | Absolute prohibition | Hard constraint |
| **SHOULD** | Recommended | Preferred but exceptions allowed |
| **SHOULD NOT** | Discouraged | Avoid but not prohibited |
| **MAY** | Optional | Implementation choice |

**Examples:**
- "The system MUST use HTTPS for all authentication endpoints"
- "Sessions SHOULD expire after 24 hours of inactivity"
- "The API MAY support rate limiting in future versions"

## Rationale Best Practices

### Good Rationale

```markdown
### Rationale

We chose JWT with refresh tokens because:
1. **Stateless authentication** aligns with our microservices architecture (no shared session store)
2. **Team familiarity** - 3 of 4 engineers have production JWT experience
3. **Ecosystem support** - jsonwebtoken is a well-maintained, audited library
4. **Constitution alignment** - follows "prefer proven over novel" principle

The trade-off of token revocation complexity is acceptable because:
- User logout can use short token expiry (15 min)
- Compromised token detection happens at gateway level
```

### Bad Rationale

```markdown
### Rationale

JWT is the best option. It's modern and everyone uses it.
```

## Consequence Documentation

### Positive Consequences

```markdown
### Positive Consequences

- Horizontal scaling without session synchronization
- Reduced database load for auth checks
- Mobile apps can use same auth mechanism
- Enables future SSO integration
```

### Negative Consequences

```markdown
### Negative Consequences

- Token revocation requires additional infrastructure (blacklist)
- Slightly larger request size (token in header)
- Must handle token refresh flow in all clients
- Token expiry requires careful tuning
```

### Neutral Consequences

```markdown
### Neutral Consequences

- Auth middleware will parse tokens instead of sessions
- User model needs tokenVersion field for revocation
- Frontend will store tokens in httpOnly cookies
```

## Dependency Documentation

Track how decisions relate:

```markdown
## Decision Dependencies

| Decision | Depends On | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| D2: Session storage | D1: Auth mechanism | JWT choice eliminates server sessions |
| D3: Token storage | D1: Auth mechanism | JWT determines how tokens are handled |
| D5: Refresh endpoint | D1: Auth mechanism | JWT requires refresh token flow |

## Impact Chain

D1 (JWT auth)
  → D2 (No server sessions)
  → D3 (Token in httpOnly cookie)
  → D5 (Refresh endpoint required)
  → API contract includes /auth/refresh
```

## Constitution Alignment

Document how decisions align with the project constitution (`.mochiko/memory/constitution.md`):

```markdown
### Constitution Alignment

| Principle | Alignment | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| "Prefer proven over novel" | Aligned | JWT is industry standard |
| "Team can maintain it" | Aligned | 3/4 engineers familiar |
| "Avoid vendor lock-in" | Aligned | Standard JWT, not proprietary |

**Deviation from principle**: None required.
```

If deviating from a principle:

```markdown
### Constitution Alignment

**Deviation required**: This decision deviates from "prefer existing stack" because:
- Existing stack uses cookie sessions (incompatible with mobile)
- Mobile app requirement mandates stateless auth
- Migration path: Gradual rollout with feature flag

**Justification accepted by**: [Escalated to the human gate and approved]
```
