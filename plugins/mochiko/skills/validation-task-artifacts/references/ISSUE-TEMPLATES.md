# Issue Classification and Templates

Severity classification rules, issue-documentation formats, the task-specific **Checks-Executed
tables**, the issue-ID conventions, and the verdict decision tree for task-artifact reviews. These
are the reviewer's working formats; the **assembled deliverable** the lead reads is the
`mochiko:advocate-report-template` (verdict + severity-bucketed findings + clarifications +
strengths) — do not restate that report shape here.

## Severity Classification

### Critical Issues

Issues that block progress or fundamentally undermine the artifact's purpose.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Missing coverage | P1/P2 story not mapped to any cycle |
| Structural violation | Horizontal slicing instead of vertical |
| TDD violation | Implementation tasks before test tasks |
| Missing foundation | No foundation cycles identified |
| Broken traceability | Cannot trace story → cycle → task |
| Missing file paths | Tasks without specific file locations |
| Missing verification | A cycle with no `**TEST:**` verification task, or a mock-only / vague one |

**Action**: Must resolve before proceeding. Return to the responsible producer.

### Important Issues

Significant gaps that should be resolved but don't fundamentally break the artifact.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Quality gaps | Vague checkpoint descriptions |
| Marker issues | Missing `[P]` markers on parallel cycles |
| Sizing issues | Cycles too large or too small |
| Dependency issues | Unnecessary inter-cycle dependencies |
| Format issues | Wrong task-ID format |

**Action**: Flag for this round. Should fix before proceeding.

### Minor Issues

Polish items that can be deferred without significant impact.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Style | Inconsistent capitalization |
| Documentation | Missing optional descriptions |
| Organization | Suboptimal cycle ordering |
| Naming | Non-descriptive cycle titles |

**Action**: Note for later. Can proceed with these unresolved.

> **Dormant / parked categories.** Brownfield `[EXTEND]`/`[MODIFY]` marker gaps (Important) and
> missing IP-XXX / deployment coverage (Critical) belong to the roadmap/brownfield track that is
> deferred for the core tasks loop. Kept here for when that track activates, in lock-step with the
> producer's parked side — not live-required in a core review.

## Issue Documentation Format

### Standard Issue Format

```markdown
**Issue {ID}**: {Brief title}

- **Check**: {Which check triggered this}
- **Severity**: {Critical/Important/Minor}
- **Evidence**: {Specific quote or reference from artifact}
- **Impact**: {Why this matters}
- **Suggested Fix**: {Actionable recommendation}
```

### Example Issues

#### Critical Issue

```markdown
**Issue TM-001**: User story US-2 not mapped to any cycle

- **Check**: Story coverage
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Evidence**: task-mapping.md contains cycles for US-1, US-3, US-4 but no mention of US-2
- **Impact**: US-2 (P1 priority) will not be implemented
- **Suggested Fix**: Add a cycle for US-2 "Task completion" covering the mark-complete functionality
```

#### Important Issue

```markdown
**Issue TT-003**: Cycle 4 is horizontally sliced

- **Check**: Vertical slice validation
- **Severity**: Important
- **Evidence**: Cycle 4 creates "all service classes" without corresponding tests or endpoints
- **Impact**: Nothing testable until later cycles complete; violates the vertical-slice principle
- **Suggested Fix**: Restructure Cycle 4 to include test, service, and endpoint for one specific behavior
```

#### Minor Issue

```markdown
**Issue TT-007**: Inconsistent cycle title capitalization

- **Check**: Format consistency
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Evidence**: "Cycle 3: task Priority" vs "Cycle 4: Task Filtering"
- **Impact**: Visual inconsistency, no functional impact
- **Suggested Fix**: Standardize to title case: "Task Priority"
```

## Checks-Executed Tables

While executing a review, record each check's result in the applicable table. These roll up into the
assembled report (see *Assembled Report* below); they are the task-specific working ledgers this
skill owns.

### Mapping review — `task-mapping.md`

| Check | Result | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Story coverage | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Cycle identification (vertical slices) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Foundation separation | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Feature parallelization | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Dependency accuracy | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Slice sizing | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Traceability (story → cycle) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Infrastructure coverage (IP-XXX) — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |
| Platform-app ordering — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |

### Tasks review — `tasks.md`

| Check | Result | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Cycle coverage | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| TDD structure (test-first ordering) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| File paths | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| `**TEST:**` verification task present | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Real-infrastructure verification (not mock-only) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Task IDs (`TN.X`) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Story labels (`[US#]`) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Parallel markers (`[P]`) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Checkpoints (human-observable) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Dependencies | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| IP-XXX task coverage — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |
| Deployment cycle — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |
| Brownfield markers (`[EXTEND]`/`[MODIFY]`) — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |

### Cross-artifact review — `tasks.md` ↔ `task-mapping.md`

| Check | Result | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Mapping-tasks alignment | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Story traceability (story → cycle → task) | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Cycle consistency | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Dependency consistency | {pass/fail} | {issue ID or -} |
| Constraint-task traceability (C-XXX → IP-XXX → Cycle → Tasks) — *dormant/parked* | {pass/fail/n·a} | {issue ID or -} |

## Assembled Report

The deliverable report the lead reads is structured with `mochiko:advocate-report-template` — the
shared producer-disclosure shape: a severity-bucketed **Gaps Found** table, **Clarifications
Needed**, the **Verdict** (`ready` / `needs-revision` / `critical-gaps`), and **What's Strong**. The
task-specific additions this skill folds in are the **Checks-Executed tables above** and the
`TM-`/`TT-`/`TX-` issue IDs. Reference the template for the report skeleton rather than re-embedding
it here.

## Verdict Decision Tree

```
Are there Critical issues?
├── Yes → verdict: critical-gaps
└── No → How many Important issues?
          ├── 0    → verdict: ready
          ├── 1-3  → verdict: needs-revision
          └── 4+   → verdict: critical-gaps
```

The verdict is a **recommendation** — a gap-finding input. The `/mochiko:tasks` lead owns the
clearing decision and routes the revision loop.

## Issue ID Conventions

| Review scope | Prefix | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Mapping | `TM-` | TM-001, TM-002 |
| Tasks | `TT-` | TT-001, TT-002 |
| Cross-artifact | `TX-` | TX-001, TX-002 |
