# Cycle Structure Reference

This reference file provides detailed cycle formatting, task structure, and examples. All formats here conform to the canonical `tasks.md` skeleton in [`tasks-template.md`](../../../templates/tasks-template.md); when the two would differ, the template wins. This file is also the canonical home of the `**TEST:**` verification-task grammar the producer authors into each cycle.

## Cycle Anatomy

```markdown
### Cycle N: [Descriptive title of the vertical slice]

> Stories: US-X, US-Y (comma-separated story IDs this cycle covers)
> Dependencies: C1, C2 (cycles that must complete first, or "None")
> Type: Foundation | Feature [P] (Foundation = sequential, Feature [P] = parallel-eligible)

- [ ] **TN.1**: Write failing test for [behavior] in [test file path]
- [ ] **TN.2**: Implement [component] to pass test in [source file path]
- [ ] **TN.3**: Refactor and verify tests pass
- [ ] **TN.4**: **TEST:** - [What to verify with real infrastructure]
  - **Setup**: [Prerequisites] (optional)
  - **Action**: [Command or instruction]
  - **Assert**: [Expected outcome]
  - **Capture**: [console, screenshot, logs] (optional)

**Checkpoint**: [Observable outcome when cycle is complete]
```

## Task ID Format

Tasks use hierarchical IDs: `T{cycle}.{sequence}`

| Cycle | Task IDs |
|-------|----------|
| Cycle 1 | T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T1.4 |
| Cycle 2 | T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4 |
| Cycle 3 | T3.1, T3.2, T3.3, T3.4 |

If a cycle needs more than 4 tasks:
- T1.5, T1.6, etc. for additional implementation
- Keep test task first, TEST verification task last

## File Path Conventions

Every task MUST include a specific file path.

### Test Files
```
tests/e2e/test_[feature].py
tests/integration/test_[feature].py
tests/unit/test_[module].py
tests/contract/test_[endpoint].py
```

### Source Files
```
src/models/[entity].py
src/services/[service].py
src/api/[endpoint].py
src/[feature]/[component].py
```

### Adjust for Project Structure

| Project Type | Source | Tests |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Single app | `src/` | `tests/` |
| Backend/Frontend | `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/` | `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/` |
| Monorepo | `packages/[pkg]/src/` | `packages/[pkg]/tests/` |

## Brownfield Markers

When working with existing code, apply markers:

| Marker | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `[EXTEND]` | Adding to existing file | Adding a field to existing model |
| `[MODIFY]` | Changing existing code | Updating existing service method |
| (none) | New file | Creating new endpoint file |

### Example with Brownfield

```markdown
### Cycle 6: [P] Task priority

> Type: Feature [P]

- [ ] **T6.1**: Write failing test for priority assignment in tests/e2e/test_task_priority.py

  - **Assert**: Response status: 201
  - **Assert**: Console contains "priority":"high"
  - **Capture**: console

**Checkpoint**: Can create tasks with priority and update existing task priority
```

## Checkpoint Guidelines

Checkpoints should be:

1. **Observable**: Something observable or demonstrable
2. **Testable**: Automated tests should verify this
3. **Concrete**: Specific behavior, not abstract quality
4. **Verifiable**: Can be verified with real infrastructure (not just mocks)

### Good Checkpoints

- "Task created via API, console shows 201 response"
- "File watcher detects new file, console outputs event"
- "CLI export command creates CSV with correct data"
- "Server starts and responds to health check"

### Bad Checkpoints

- "Task model is complete" (not observable)
- "Code is clean" (subjective)
- "Service layer works" (too vague)
- "Ready for integration" (not testable)
- "All unit tests pass" (automated only, needs real verification)
- "PathValidator correctly rejects symlinks" (tested via mocks, not real files)
- "State updates reactively" (vague, likely tested via mocks)

---

## Verification Task Requirements

The final task of each cycle (typically TN.4, or the last task in longer cycles) is the **Verification** task. This is NOT just another automated test—it is the gate that ensures the cycle delivers real, working functionality.

### What Verification MUST Include

1. **Real Infrastructure**: Use real file systems, real databases, real APIs—NOT mocks
2. **Tangible Output**: Something observable (console output, file, response, UI state)
3. **Explicit Steps**: Concrete commands or actions to perform
4. **Observable Outcome**: What should be observed when it works

### Unified TEST: Format

Use the `**TEST:**` marker for all verification tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] **TN.X**: **TEST:** - {Description}
  - **Setup**: {Prerequisites} (optional)
  - **Action**: {Command or instruction}
  - **Assert**: {Expected outcome}
  - **Capture**: {console, screenshot, logs} (optional)
```

A **downstream verification step classifies tasks at runtime** and decides whether to auto-approve or present a human checkpoint:

| Classification | Criteria | Execution |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **CLI** | Backtick commands + measurable asserts | May auto-approve if 100% pass |
| **GUI** | UI actions, screenshot captures | Human checkpoint |
| **SUBJECTIVE** | Qualitative terms (looks, feels) | Human checkpoint |

**No explicit classification is needed** for whether a task needs human verification — the downstream verification step handles this at runtime. The producer authors the `**TEST:**` task and its fields; it does not decide the runtime approval mode.

### Field Definitions

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `**Setup**:` | No | Prerequisites to establish before testing |
| `**Action**:` | Yes | Commands or instructions to execute |
| `**Assert**:` | Yes | Conditions to verify (outcomes) |
| `**Capture**:` | No | Evidence types to collect |

### Action Modifiers

| Modifier | Example | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `(background)` | `npm start (background)` | Run async, track PID |
| `(timeout Ns)` | `curl ... (timeout 10s)` | Override 60s default |
| `(in {path})` | `make build (in ./backend)` | Execute in directory |

### Assert Patterns

| Pattern | Verification |
|---------|--------------|
| `Console contains "{text}"` | Substring match in output |
| `Console contains "{text}" (within Ns)` | Timed match |
| `File exists: {path}` | Check file system |
| `Response status: {code}` | HTTP status check |

### Examples

**CLI verification** (may auto-approve):
```markdown
- [ ] **T2.12**: **TEST:** - File watcher detects real file changes
  - **Setup**: `mkdir /tmp/watcher-test`
  - **Action**: `dart run bin/watcher.dart /tmp/watcher-test` (background)
  - **Action**: `sleep 1 && touch /tmp/watcher-test/test.jsonl`
  - **Assert**: Console contains "FileWatchEvent: created"
  - **Capture**: console
```

**API verification** (may auto-approve):
```markdown
- [ ] **T4.8**: **TEST:** - API server responds to health check
  - **Setup**: Ensure database is running
  - **Action**: `npm start` (background) (timeout 30s)
  - **Action**: `sleep 2 && curl -s localhost:3000/health`
  - **Assert**: Response status: 200
  - **Assert**: Console contains "Server listening on port 3000"
  - **Capture**: console
```

**GUI verification** (human checkpoint):
```markdown
- [ ] **T4.16**: **TEST:** - Sessions appear in UI from real files
  - **Setup**: Build app with `flutter build macos`
  - **Setup**: Create test session file in Claude sessions directory
  - **Action**: Launch the built application
  - **Assert**: Session appears in list within 1 second
  - **Assert**: Session shows correct project path with ~ alias
  - **Capture**: screenshot
```

**Subjective verification** (human checkpoint):
```markdown
- [ ] **T5.10**: **TEST:** - Dashboard layout is well-organized
  - **Action**: Open dashboard at localhost:3000/dashboard
  - **Assert**: Layout feels balanced and spacing looks consistent
  - **Capture**: screenshot
```

### Bad Verification Tasks

```markdown
# BAD: Just re-running automated tests
- [ ] **T2.12**: Demo: Verify file watching infrastructure is functional
  - Checkpoint: PathValidator correctly rejects symlinks outside scope

# BAD: Vague with no concrete steps
- [ ] **T4.16**: Demo: Verify full user story functionality
  - Checkpoint: All 5 acceptance scenarios pass

# BAD: Relies on mocked infrastructure
- [ ] **T3.12**: Demo: Verify state management is functional
  - Checkpoint: State updates reactively from file events
```

### Why This Matters

Mocked tests verify that code does what the tests say. Real verification ensures the system does what the user needs. Without verification:

- All tests can pass while the feature doesn't work
- Integration issues between real components go undetected
- The "vertical slice" isn't actually vertical—it stops at the mock boundary

### Legacy Format Support

For backward compatibility, the downstream verification step accepts these legacy markers (internally mapped to TEST:):
- `**TEST:VERIFY**`
- `**TEST:CONTRACT**`
- `**HUMAN VERIFICATION**` (maps Setup/Action/Verify fields)

## Complete Example: Task Management Feature

This worked `tasks.md` illustrates the canonical structure defined by [`tasks-template.md`](../../../templates/tasks-template.md) — the fill-target. It is an illustration, not a second source: the `[P]`/`[US#]`/`[EXTEND]`/`[MODIFY]` markers, the `TN.X` task IDs, the `**Checkpoint**:` lines, and the `**TEST:**` blocks below match that template so the two cannot drift. The Story → Cycle table is a **derived echo** of `task-mapping.md` (the source of truth), not an independent second mapping.
